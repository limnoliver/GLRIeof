# troubleshooting ideas

# are your variables in the same order as your clean_names?
# to test, pull concentration, load, other_responses vars and see if they match your
# clean vars. E.g., 

# did the predictor variables pull properly - and return what you expected?
# to test, get predictors, print them out and verify they are what you want them to be

# dates - are the pulled in dates what you expected, and do they match across variables? E.g., did 
# the time zones get properly read in and aligned?
